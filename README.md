# next-recoil-market

> Personal demo of me trying Next.js with Recoil by building a simple market.

### Description

Been wanting to try [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) for a while, here is me playing around with it. Choose Next over React SPA because I like it more.

### How to install

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SunstroUS/next-recoil-market.git

$ cd next-recoil-market

$ yarn install

$ yarn dev

```

### Verdict

_meh_
